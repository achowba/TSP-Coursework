## Travelling Salesman Problem using Java

### N/B:

This project is for a school assignment which required me to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) using Java. I was required to import a *.txt* file containing the **_city number_**, **_x and y coordinates_** and then read the contents of the *.txt* file into the code as parameters.

The code for the algorithm was gotten from **here: (http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5).**
